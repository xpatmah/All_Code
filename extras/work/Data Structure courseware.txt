Week 1
Common Topics:- 

Arrays
Linked List 
Stack
Queue 
Searching (Only Binary search and linear search and most of the search is based on sorting)

Sorting:-

Selection Sort/Bubble Sort/Insertion Sort/
Merge sort
Quick Sort/In Place Quick Sort /
Duel Pivot Quick Sort / 3 Way Partitioning Quick Sort 
Priority Queue
Heap Sort
Tournament Sort(NPTL Lec Case Study I Third Part)
Bucket Sort
Counting Sort(it is a counting sort because it works for integer key check geeks for geek and wikipedia link)/LSD Redix Sort
MSD Redix sort
Cycle sort
Shell sort
Tower of Hanoi
Tim Sort (Only Concepts)

Week 2
Trees:- 12

Binary search Tree(Tree Sort - Creating a tree and traversing it in inorder)
Level Order Traversal/Reverse Level Order Traversal
Tree Traversal (InOrder,PreOrder and PostOrder with stack and Queue)
Threaded Binary Tree(one method is to update the pointer while adding and removing the pointer and other is to have the parent pointer)
Expression Tree 
AVL Tree 
Red Black Tree
#Generic Trees(n Ary tree and the concept the next sibling and first child)
#M way search Tree
#B Tree only
#B+ Trees


Week 3
Graphs(15 Days):- 12

Graph Implementation (Adjacency Metrics &&
Adjacency Edge List)
DFS (Adjacency Metrics &&
Adjacency Edge List)
BFS (Adjacency Metrics &&
Adjacency Edge List)
Disjoint Sets
Sortest Path Algorithms (Dijkstra Algorithm , 
Bellman Ford Algorithm, 
Floyd and Warshell Algorithms) 
Minimum Spanning Tree (Prims 
and Kruskal's) --> Disjoint Sets
Maximum Flow Algorithm (Ford fulkerson algorithm)
Topological Sort(is a form of DFS and giving the no from the last node and for directed graph only )
Eulerian path and circuit 

Week 4

Question Based :-
