This is one my favourite question, i am going to discuss it in a very detailed manner. 
serialVersionUID is used for version control of object.
If we  don’t define serialVersionUID in the class, and any modification is made in class, 
then we won’t be able to deSerialize our class because serialVersionUID generated 
by java compiler for modified class will be different from old serialized object.
And deserialization process will end up throwing java.io.InvalidClassException  
(because of serialVersionUID mismatch)
